# Wildfire-prediction-using-satellite-images

**Wildfire Prediction Using Satellite Images**

This project focuses on developing a predictive model that analyzes satellite images to identify potential wildfire areas. Leveraging advanced techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning architectures like DenseNet, MobileNet, and VGG, alongside ensemble methods, the model aims to accurately classify images into wildfire and non-wildfire categories.

**Key Components:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Augmentation techniques and filters are applied to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes a CNN constructed with the Keras API and TensorFlow backend, comprising essential layers for feature extraction and prediction.
- **Experimental Protocol:** The Wildfire Prediction Dataset (Satellite Images) from Kaggle is utilized, and computational resources such as GPU accelerators are employed to optimize training speed.

**Results and Analysis:**
- **Qualitative Results:** Evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and visualizations of predicted test images showcase the model's performance.
